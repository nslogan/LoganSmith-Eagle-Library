# LoganSmith-Eagle-Library

Logan's personal Eagle library used in all of his projects.

Before he get's around to better summarizing his intentions with this library, check out his blog post about it on [ThumperFI](http://thumperfi.com/2014/07/20/eagle-library/).

Release 0.1 is in the works, if you're looking for the latest updates check out the [develop branch](https://github.com/nslogan/LoganSmith-Eagle-Library/tree/develop). The target goals for 0.1:

* Update README with goals and overview of library
* Update Guidelines to include rules for creating footprints, adding parts, required attributes for specific libraries, etc.
* Create basic library structure (resistors, capacitors, digital IC, analog IC, etc.)
* Move some if not all parts from other custom libraries in to appropriate libraries
